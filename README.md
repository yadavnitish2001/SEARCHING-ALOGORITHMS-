# Linear and Binary Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms in different programming languages. Each algorithm is implemented with detailed explanations and comments for educational purposes.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Linear Search**: Simple linear search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list.

2. **Binary Search**: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays, dividing the search space in half at each step.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in [programming language] and can be found in its respective directory. Follow the instructions in each directory to run the implementations.

Feel free to contribute by optimizing existing code or providing implementations in additional programming languages.
